# Next.js + TailwindCSS Boilerplate

I got extremely tired of creating the boilerplate for websites using Next.js & TailwindCSS. I finally got around to creating a repository that I can clone whenever I create a new website. About time!

Feel free to clone or fork and make it your own! I do not own anything in this repository; it's simply a Next.js project configured to work with TailwindCSS and TypeScript.
